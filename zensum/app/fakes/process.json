Partially or completely.</p><p>If you are familiar with Scrum, 'Inspect &amp; Adapt'.</p><p>With ZenSum, you learn how to see the reality, measure impacts and adapt. That's the key to success.</p><p>Be pragmatic, not dogmatic.</p><p>A living process that evolves and adapts to a changing reality, is a good symptom that an organization is alive.</p>"
